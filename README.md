This repo contains my work for the Final Assignment of Coursera Getting &amp; Cleaning Data from the Data Science Specialisation Course.

The R script saved in this repo is used to do the following:

- Combine the training and testing datasets with the subject & activity datasets
- Extract those features containing std and mean including subject & activity
- Summarising the resulting dataset by Subject & Activity
- The resulting tidy dataset was outputted as 'tidy_data.txt'
