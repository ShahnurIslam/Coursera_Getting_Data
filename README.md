# Coursera Getting Data Introduction

This repo contains my work for the Final Assignment of Coursera Getting &amp; Cleaning Data from the Data Science Specialisation Course.

### Script Description

The data used in the script 'run_analysis.R' is provided [here](http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Human+Activity+Recognition+Using+Smartphones). in a zip file

Before running any R script you need to have the following completed:

1. Download and extracted the dataset from the zip file
2. Set your working directory to the extracted folder 'UCI HAR Dataset'
3. Have the package **'reshape2'** installed for your R session

The R script saved in this repo combines the training & testing datasets then extracts all features related to mean or standard deviation.
The resultling tidy dataset is outputted as 'tidy_data.txt' & can be also be found in the Repo

### Codebook Description

A codebook(codebook.md) can be found in this repo describing the variables, the data and the work done to clean up the data.
